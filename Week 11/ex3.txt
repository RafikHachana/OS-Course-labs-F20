In Program 1, the output is 2 lines each one with the word Hello
In Program 1, the output is 3 lines: the first line contains the word Hello, the other 2 lines are empty


This is because printf uses a line buffer (output is buffered until a '\n' character is added)

Explanation: in program 1, Hello is put in the buffer, then fork creates a child process with the same buffer.
We end up with 2 processes, each process has Hello in each buffer, waiting to be printed to the console.
When we print the '\n' character, the buffer is cleared and "Hello\n" is printed twice.

In program 2, "Hello\n" goes to the buffer but it is cleared immediately since it ends with a new line character
Therefore "Hello\n" is printed.
After that, the process forks and we have 2 processes, each of them prints a newline character, thus the 2 empty lines at the end of the output.
