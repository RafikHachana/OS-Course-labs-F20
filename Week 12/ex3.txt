If we increase the buffer size, the copy program becomes faster. 

If the buffer is too small, it gets cleared often, and each time it is cleared the program issues a system call to write to the destination file. System calls are costly and they slow down the program.


If we add the O_SYNC flag by defining SYNC in the preprocessor directives (check line 24 of copy.c), the program becomes slower.
This is due to the input and output being synced, i.e. the program waits for the system to write in the output file before reading the next bit of data from the input file.


Here are the time stats results for comparison:

DBUF_SIZE=1, NO SYNC:

real	0m0.009s
user	0m0.009s
sys	0m0.000s

DBUF_SIZE=4, NO SYNC:

real	0m0.004s
user	0m0.004s
sys	0m0.001s


DBUF_SIZE=4, NO SYNC:

real	0m0.003s
user	0m0.003s
sys	0m0.000s

DBUF_SIZE=1, WITH SYNC:

real	0m23.217s
user	0m0.012s
sys	0m0.126s

BUF_SIZE=4, WITH SYNC:

real	0m5.634s
user	0m0.001s
sys	0m0.036s

DBUF_SIZE=16, WITH SYNC:

real	0m1.556s
user	0m0.001s
sys	0m0.011s
